# PickPark Proof of Concept Mobile Application
## Project: PickPark
- **Platform:** React Native with Expo
- **Timeline:** 6 Weeks
- **Team Members:**
    - **Dylan Verallo:** Backend and QA
    - **Nicholas Schwamborn:** Frontend and UI/UX
    - **Jesse Wattenhofer:** Project Manager, Frontend, UI/UX
    - **James Abuan:** TBD

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a proof-of-concept mobile application using React Native and Expo to demonstrate key functionality, technical feasibility, and user experience for a targeted use case.

**PickPark** simplifies parking searches by providing users with real-time options based on their location. The app integrates seamlessly with mapping services to display nearby parking spots along with pricing details and user reviews. With this, users can quickly assess affordability, convenience, and security before choosing a parking location—eliminating the hassle found in busy or unfamiliar neighborhoods.

## Objectives
- Develop a mobile app with core features to solve a specific problem or fulfill a user need.

- Validate app viability through prototyping and testing.

- Demonstrate understanding of mobile development principles, project management, and teamwork.

## [REQUIRED FEATURES]
- Navigation: 4 Screens

- Forms: 2 Forms with validation

- Remote Data Storage

- Data Fetching

## Week-by-Week Plan
## Week 1: Planning and Setup
- Define project scope and goals.

- Research target users and competitors.

- Assign team roles and responsibilities.

- Create wireframes and user flow diagrams.

- Set up project repository (GitHub).

- Choose tech stack, libraries, and tools (e.g., Firebase, React Navigation, Redux).

**Deliverables:**

- Project proposal document.

- Wireframes and flowcharts.

- Initial GitHub repository with project structure.

## Week 2: Authentication & Basic UI Foundation
- **Deliverable 1:** Set up the React Native project with a consistent project structure and initial navigation framework.

- **Deliverable 2:** Develop and design the login and registration screens with input validation and error handling.

- **Deliverable 3:** Establish a basic user management system (using dummy data or a simple API) and create the initial profile placeholder.

## Week 3: Map Integration & Parking Listings
- **Deliverable 1:** Integrate a map API (e.g., Google Maps) to display a basic map view within the app.

- **Deliverable 2:** Implement a search bar that allows users to filter and search for parking locations on the map.

- **Deliverable 3:** Develop map markers for parking spots and correlate them with a dynamic list view showcasing available parking details.

## Week 4: Parking Details & User Interaction Features
- **Deliverable 1:** Enrich parking markers and list items with detailed information (price, location, additional parking info).

- **Deliverable 2:** Implement favoriting functionality, enabling users to bookmark preferred parking spots.

- **Deliverable 3:** Add a "recently viewed" feature to track parking spots that users have interacted with.

## Week 5: Reviews, Theming, & Profile Enhancements
- **Deliverable 1:** Allow users to submit and read reviews for parking spots, establishing an in-app review system.

- **Deliverable 2:** Develop a theme toggle (light/dark mode) and refine overall UI/UX consistency across screens.

- **Deliverable 3:** Enhance the profile section to provide full access to account information and settings, followed by thorough testing and debugging ahead of a beta release.

## Week 6: Polish and Presentation
- Finalize outstanding bug fixes.

- Polish UI and enhance user experience.

- Create comprehensive project documentation.

- Prepare a final demo and presentation.

**Deliverables:**

- Fully functional proof-of-concept app.

- README with setup instructions.

- Team presentation/demonstration.

## Success Criteria
1. **Functionality:** All required features are implemented and meet defined specifications.

2. **User Experience:** Positive feedback from user testing and demonstration sessions.

3. **Performance:** The app operates smoothly on all targeted devices with minimal bugs or crashes.

4. **Technical Feasibility:** Successful integration of mapping APIs, remote data storage, and dynamic list rendering.

5. **Team Collaboration:** Effective communication and task management leading to the timely completion of all milestones.

_Ownership for each criterion will be assigned among team members based on their roles and responsibilities._

## Tools & Libraries
- **Mobile Development:** React Native / Expo

- **Mapping:** Google Maps API (or a similar service)

- **Task Management:** GitHub Projects

- **Additional tools/libraries:** [List additional tools and libraries, such as Firebase, Redux, etc.]

## Sprint Planning & Team Meetings
- **Sprint Duration:** 1 Week

- **Kickoff Meeting:** Every Wednesday – Set sprint goals, assign tasks, and review feedback from the previous week.

- **Stand-Up Meetings:** 15-minute daily check-ins (via Discord, Slack, or in-person) to share progress, blockers, and updates.

- **Midweek Sync:** Optional working session/check-in to support collaboration.

- **Sprint Review & Retrospective:** Every Wednesday – Demo completed features, gather feedback, and identify improvements for the next sprint.

**Task Management:** All tasks are tracked using GitHub Projects with clear descriptions, deadlines, and review requirements.

**Communication Tools:** The team will use Slack, Discord, or similar tools for real-time communication.
