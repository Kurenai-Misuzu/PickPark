# Testing Summary for PickPark

Due to issues with Jest test configuration and `react-native` modules (e.g. `react-native-reanimated`, `react-native-gesture-handler`), some automated tests failed to run successfully.

## What was attempted

- Created jest-setup.ts to mock required native modules.
- Added unit tests in __tests__/HomeScreen.test.tsx and Hello.test.tsx.
- Configured jest.config.js with correct setupFiles and setupFilesAfterEnv.
- Resolved red squiggly import errors in _layout.tsx and related files.
- Attempted multiple Jest configurations and cleanup strategies.
- Tried rendering and validating parking location cards using sample test data.
- Encountered persistent module resolution and UI rendering failures in tests.

## Manual Verification

- Home screen successfully renders parking cards from test data
- Search bar is visible and interactive
- Theme and navigation flows function as expected
- GitHub commits reflect ongoing progress and feature completion

## Notes

- React Native unit testing remains brittle without full mocks or E2E tools.
