# Week 10 - Testing and Code Quality Summary

## Supabase Auth Context Cleanup

- **Removed** legacy `UserContext.tsx` and replaced with `useUser()` from `@supabase/auth-helpers-react`.
- Ensured `RootLayout.tsx` wraps everything in `<SessionContextProvider>` and properly loads the `supabaseClient`.

## Policy Fix for Supabase Insert Errors

- Initially encountered row-level security (RLS) error: `new row violates row-level security policy for table "Locations"`.
- Fixed with Supabase policy:
  ```sql
  create policy "Enable insert for authenticated users"
  on "public"."Locations"
  as permissive
  for insert
  to public
  with check (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);
  ```

## Component Context Error Fix

- Fixed `useFavorites` error (`must be used within FaveProvider`) by:
  - Importing `FaveProvider` and wrapping screen components in `_layout.tsx`.

## Testing Summary (20%)

- **Unit Test File Added**: `__tests__/HomeScreen.test.tsx`
- **Tested:** Basic rendering of HomeScreen and UI label.
- **Tools Used**:
  - `Jest`
  - `@testing-library/react-native`
- Example:
  ```ts
  it("renders the HomeScreen label", async () => {
    const { findByText } = render(<HomeScreen />);
    const label = await findByText(/dog explorer search/i);
    expect(label).toBeTruthy();
  });
  ```

## Remaining Bugs & Notes

- Still debugging:
  - Location insert errors (policy now in place).
  - Ensure all screen components wrapped in context providers.
  - Some tests fail due to unmocked native modules.
